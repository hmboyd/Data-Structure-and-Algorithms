# Coding Interview Preparation


### UMPIRE

#### U

- **U = Understand**
- Make sure you know what the problem is asking
- Ask any clarifying questions on inputs and outputs
- Create test cases
  * Test cases should not be too easy, nor too hard, and should encompass a wide-rage of cases
  * To convince yourself and the interviewer that the solution is correct

#### M

- **M = Match**
- Identify what type of problem you are solving
  * E.g. is this a problem a graph/linked list problem? Is this a pattern I've seen before
  * Data structure brainstorm might be a good idea sometimes
- **Match** and **Plan** are usually the hardest part for most problems
- You might need to go back and forth **Match** and **Plan** until you find an algorithm that you are confident with

#### P

- **P = Plan**
- What techniques/pattern do you know that you can use with the type of problem you've identified
  * E.g. if you know that the problem you are given is a graphs problem, then you know you can do DFS/BFS traversals with the graph 
- What additional auxiliary data structures might you need?
- Sanity check your approach with the test-cases you made
- Write down any important details so you don't forget them while coding in the next step
- **Do not go past this step without having an algorithm**

#### I

- **I = Implement**
- Translate your algorithm into code
- This is arguably one of the easier steps. If you prepared properly, then coding should be second nature
- **Coding becomes really easy as you do more problems**

#### R

- **R = Reviews**
- Give a runthrough of your code line-by-line, see if there are any egregious syntax/logic errors
- If you find a bug, make sure you don't cause regressions by fixing it
- **Make sure you test your code with the test cases you made**

#### E

- **E = Evaluate**
- State the runtime/space complexity of your code
- Discuss any other pros/cons in your solution
